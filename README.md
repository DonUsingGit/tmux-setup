# This is my first use of Git. First timer :-) I'm running 22.04 ubuntu 

This repository contains my custom **tmux** setup, including configurations for:
- **tmux** (terminal multiplexer)
- **newsboat** (RSS reader)
- **iftop** (network monitoring)
- **ticker** (stock market tracker)

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

To set up everything on a new Ubuntu system, open a terminal and run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:DonUsingGit/tmux-setup.git
cd tmux-setup
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```


This script will:
- Install **tmux, newsboat, iftop, and Go**
- Clone and compile **ticker**
- Copy configuration files to the correct locations

## ðŸ”„ Running Your Setup

Once installed, you can launch your customized tmux session by running:

```sh
~/news.sh
```

This will start tmux with:
- **Ticker (top left pane)** showing stock prices
- **Newsboat (bottom left pane)** for reading RSS feeds
- **iftop (bottom right pane)** for network monitoring
- **Neofetch (top right pane)** showing system information
